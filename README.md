# odin-recipes

This is my first Odin Project HTML project. I think it will be easy and mostly review but I am enjoying using github. I wish we would have used this more in school. 

I really liked this lesson because of the use of github. It is making so much more sense to me now, but I know I have a lot more to learn.
